"SourceMeshes.rar" contains source .fbx files.

If you'd like to modify these files and intergare them into your project,
unpack "SourceMeshes.rar" to Content > MultistoryDungeons

Resulting folder structure should look like this:

>Content
  >MultistoryDungeons
    >Source_FBX
    >Source_FBX_Props

When you next time load your project, click "Don't Import" when a little window
pops up, telling you that UE detected changes to source files,
otherwise this will break the statick meshes (reported many times).

For some reason, UE is going to asks you to specify the file location the first
time you reimport a model even if you put everything in correct folders.
Not sure why this happens, but you can check the source file name and path in the
import settings of a static mesh.

Note that every model in the pack comes with a custom collision. If a collision
of any model looks broken or autogenerated, please make sure that
"Auto Generate Collision" is unchecked in the import settings and
"Customized Collision" is checked.
